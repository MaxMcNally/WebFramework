BB5,Bark Buddy Hush Puppy No-Bark Training System,39.99,18.50,,Bark Buddy,Black Dog Manufacturing,"<p>Barking is a dog’s natural way of reacting to stimuli. It is their  natural response when interacting with friends, family and even  strangers. It’s their own way of communicating fear, trust or just plain  curiosity.</p> <p>Although it’s quite normal for dogs to bark, excessive barking, can  be a potential problem if left unresolved. It can cause a disturbance in  your home and neighborhood. More importantly, we always make it a point  to try to make our dogs well-behaved both at home and in public places  as excessive barking can cause fear and alarm. Why do some dogs behave  this way? There might be several reasons why your dog is barking more  aggressively than he should.</p> <p>Black Dog offers you an all-in-one solution that can help with  training your dog to bark less and at the proper times – the Hush Puppy  No-Bark Training System (Model BB5).</p> <p>Proven effective and safe, its small, lightweight design is suited  for all types of dogs weighing 10 lbs. and up. Its durable collar is  adjustable from 5” to 24” ensuring that your dog is comfortable at all  times.</p> <p>The Hush Puppy BB5’s effectiveness lies in the fact that you can  easily select which level is appropriate to your dog’s needs.

The Hush Puppy BB5  features 5 sensitivity levels to ensure that your dog is free to bark  whenever needed, most especially during potentially dangerous  situations.</p> <p>Giving the freedom for dogs to <em>be</em> dogs, the Hush Puppy BB5 is completely waterproof, allowing your dog to roam and explore as much as he wants and <em>still</em>  be on bark training.

Not only does this make the installation of your new pet  containment systems hassle free, it also eliminates any potential loss  of signal that may result from burying the boundary wire under several  inches of dirt, not to mention the backaches and blisters it will save  you.</p> <p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Using Dog Fence Staples is Quick &amp; Easy</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Step 1:</span></p> <ol><li>First run your twisted wire from your transmitter out to the beginning of your boundary. </li><li>Now ""Staple"" the twisted wire to the ground by hammering in a wire ""Staple"" every 5 - 6 feet. </li><li>Now stop and look at the wire. Is it completely flush to the ground  all the way to the start of the boundary? If not go and ""Staple"" any  raised areas before proceeding to the next step. The wire MUST  completely touch the ground. </li></ol> <p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Step 2:</span></p> <ol><li>Next, place a ""Staple"" where the twisted wire and the beginning of  the boundary meet (if you have a splice in this area please dig a small  hole about 2 inches deep and bury the splice. Then place a ""Staple"" in  the front of and behind the splice to relieve any pressure on the  splice) </li><li>Now walk the wire to the first corner of your boundary and ""Staple""  it to the ground. Repeat this step for all four corners of your  boundary. </li><li>Next go back just as you did with your twisted wire and ""Staple"" any  raised areas down until they are completely flush with the ground. </li></ol> <p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">It is that simple.</span></p> <p>You have no need to worry about people tripping over the wire because  it is completely flush to the ground and will be completely hidden  within 7-10 days. You also do not need to worry about your lawnmower  cutting the wire as the blades will never get anywhere near the wire.  Nobody cuts their lawns to shorter than an inch, with the vast majority  of people keeping them at 2"" - 3"" inches, the wire is flush to the  ground and cannot be cut.</p> <p>These instructions will not be included with your pet fence. You  should print this page if you are going to use the Above Ground  Installation method.</p> <p>There are really only a couple of instances where burying the wire is preferable.</p> <ol><li> <p>If you are putting a fence into a pasture area where livestock such  as horses or cattle will frequent, then you will want to bury the wire  as their hooves will create breaks. In this case you will want the wire  at least 8 - 10 inches underground.</p> </li><li> <p>If you frequently have your yard aerated you will want the wire at  least 5 - 6 inches in the ground. Although if you do an above ground  installation you can simply avoid the exterior boundaries when  performing the aeration.</p> </li></ol>",https://www.essentialpetproducts.com/Pet-Fence-Staples_p_298.html,http://www.essentialpetproducts.com/assets/images/ss-100.jpg,,,,1,4.00,10.00,7.00,4.00,Underground Fences/Wire & Flags,,853585166483,33950,1,,,

Since the Turtle-Topper is placed on top of the tank, it allows you to fill your turtle tank up almost completely to the top. Free to swim in the entire tank, the result is a healthier and happier turtle. Some additional benefits of the Turtle Topper include a greater volume of water which will stay cleaner for a longer period of time.</p> <p>Due to the deeper water you are now free to use any type of filter you choose, including those which would not normally function in the lower water levels normally maintained in turtle tanks. Also, since the Turtle-Topper is supported by the top of the tank, it will hold the weight of larger and multiple turtles without sinking, keeping your turtles completely dry. Unique underwater resting platform allows your turtle a place to rest and get air without having to swim to the surface. Includes 2 mounting rims for clamp lamps to take care of your turtle's basking requirements.</p> <p><strong>Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Dimensions: 17"" x 14"" x 10""</li> <li>Fits most rectangular tanks up to 55 gallons</li> <li>Access Door allows UVB penetration</li> <li>See through cover</li> <li>Easy to Clean</li> <li>Access ramp with maximum water level indicator</li> <li>Adjustable suction cup holders for secure positioning</li> <li>Features a basking platform and underwater resting platform</li> <li>Lid has clamp lamp mounting rims on both ends</li> <li>Ramp opening is 6.75 inches wide</li> <li>Enables higher water level for healthier Turtles</li> </ul>",https://www.essentialpetproducts.com/Turtle-Topper-Above-Tank-Basking-Platform_p_1944.html,http://www.essentialpetproducts.com/assets/images/rep600.jpg,,,,1,6.00,20.00,16.00,12.00,Reptile Products,,030172061936,38118,7,,,

Perimeter’s exclusive Comfort Contacts cushion your  pet’s neck with soft rubber, unlike the hard steel probes used in other  pet fences. Veterinarians prefer the softness of the Comfort Contacts to  help reduce the incidence of skin irritations.</p><p>Chances are you heard about pet fencing from a friend or neighbor.

(No System can function with the wire  completely broken.)&nbsp;&nbsp;The field width will remain constant on both sides  of a damaged boundary wire due to the power output management built into  every Perimeter&reg; brand dog fence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Should you experience a catastrophic  event resulting in total wire failure your system will give you a  constant audible indication of the breach.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Patented Battery Check</strong>™<strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Only  Perimeter&reg; brand dog fence systems monitor the status of your battery  every two hours to ensure you know when your dog fence needs a new  battery.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other brands offer low battery indication however it only lets  you know when the battery dips below a certain output level.&nbsp;&nbsp;The  chemical composition of a battery fluctuates over a variety of different  operating conditions which could potentially signal a false low battery  indication.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perimeter&reg;

If he continues to approach the protected area, a mild correction is given. The PetSafe Indoor Pet Barrier can be used for as many pets as you have! Each pet needs to wear a collar which can be purchased separately.</P> <P>The PetSafe Indoor Pet Barrier can be put anywhere, in a plant, next to the front door, hanging on a wall or in the coffee table drawer. Whether it is hanging, standing or laying your pet will not be able to dig in your plants, run out the front door when guests arrive or beg for food at the dinner table. No training and No installation, simply place the small transmitter in the areas you don't want your dog to be, put the collar on him and watch as he stays away from the protected areas. You can use as many collars and transmitters as you need.</P>",https://www.essentialpetproducts.com/PetSafe-Stubborn-Dog-Indoor-Pet-Barrier_p_301.html,http://www.essentialpetproducts.com/assets/images/petsafe-stubborn-dog-indoor-radio-fence.jpg,,,,1,4.00,7.00,14.00,4.00,Wireless Fences,,0636391737630,33950,1,,,

Merely place the transmitter anywhere in your home or garage area and the signal will easily transmit through walls, doors, and furniture. With the purchase of extra PetSafe PIF00-12918 dog collars, you can include as many dogs as you wish with your Stay + Play system. The stream-lined design also makes it ideal for taking it with you when you are traveling with your pet.</P> <P>The wireless border created by the transmitter results in a circular boundary around your yard that can be easily adjusted up to 3/4 of an acre (210 feet across). It is simple to expand the containment area with the purchase of additional transmitters by overlapping the boundaries. After you have your wireless boundary set up, the next phase is to place the receiver collar included with the system around your dog's neck. As your dog roams freely within your yard, the collar will acquire the signal from the transmitter. Each time your dog nears the wireless perimeter, an alert tone is going to be emitted by the collar. If your dog continues in the direction of the off-limit boundaries, he will receive an instant but safe static correction.</P> <P>The wireless dog collar included with the Stay + Play Wireless Pet Fence is designed for dogs weighing over 5 pounds with neck sizes of 6 to 23 inches. It features 6 levels of static correction, to help you easily adjust the correction level for your dog's personality. You may also set your collar to ""tone only"" for training or if you think maybe that is all your dog requires as a deterrent. The collar comes with a rechargeable battery and a handy 2-hour recharging unit.</P> <P>Add-A-Pet: If you have multiple dogs, additional receiver collars can be purchased. A limitless number of pets can be added to the fence as long as they are wearing a PetSafe Stay + Play Wireless Fence receiver collar.
